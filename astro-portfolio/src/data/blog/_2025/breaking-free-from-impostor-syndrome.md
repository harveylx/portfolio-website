At one point in my career, I genuinely questioned whether I had chosen the wrong path. After months of harsh interactions with colleagues, being met with raised voices and visible frustration whenever I asked questions, I had started to believe I wasn't cut out for software engineering. Today, I'm a Senior Software Engineer working on complex distributed systems for a financial platform. This is the story of how I got here.

## The Job That Changed Everything (For Better and Worse)

After being made redundant from my previous role, I found myself with two opportunities. One was with a major UK tech company, a household name that would have looked impressive on any CV. The other was another large company where a former colleague had recommended me. The role would involve working with technologies I had barely touched: event-driven architectures, Domain-Driven Design, containerisation, Pub/Sub messaging, and CQRS patterns.

I had a decision to make. The safe choice was obvious, but something about the other company intrigued me. Yes, there were red flags. The team would only have three people. I'd be thrown in the deep end with technologies I didn't know. My former colleague's partner would be my manager, which raised concerns about workplace dynamics. But I made what seemed like the brave choice at the time: I accepted the role that would challenge me the most.

In hindsight, that decision was both the best and worst thing I could have done.

## When Learning Becomes a Battlefield

The team structure was simple: me, my manager (let's call them Daisy), and an exceptionally gifted senior engineer (let's call them Adam). On paper, this should have been an incredible learning opportunity. Adam was a brilliant engineer who had created many of the tools and practices the company relied on. Daisy had deep domain knowledge, having built much of the system I'd be working on. I was excited to learn from them both.

What I didn't anticipate was the environment this would create.

Adam lived and breathed code. He was technically exceptional, but that technical excellence came with expectations that everyone around him operated at the same level. Over the following months, a pattern emerged that would fundamentally change how I viewed myself as an engineer.

During code reviews, I'd ask questions about concepts or terminology I wasn't familiar with. Rather than explanations, I was often met with raised voices and visible frustration. The response would be to repeat the question, louder, as if the problem was that I simply hadn't heard them the first time. The implicit message was always the same: I should have known this already.

I remember one particular incident vividly. I had asked a question about something in my code, genuinely trying to understand. The frustration in Adam's response was palpable. He raised his voice, repeated the exact same question, and I could see the disappointment written across his face.

I didn't show any response in that moment, just clarification. But later I broke down. Not just in that moment, but something inside me fundamentally broke. Nobody had ever treated me like this in my professional career. This wasn't an isolated incident; it was becoming the norm. Asking for clarification was seen as a failure, not a learning opportunity.

## The Vicious Cycle of Self-Doubt

The culture on the team was paradoxical. I was frequently told "it's okay that you don't know things" and encouraged to "ask questions whenever you need to." But the reality didn't match the words.

During pair programming sessions, the pattern continued. I'd ask a question, and I could hear the audible sighs, the frustration building in their responses. The body language screamed what the words wouldn't say: you should know this already. These weren't one-off bad days; this became the consistent dynamic over months of working together.

I felt like I was in an impossible situation. I was working with two people who had either created the systems or had years of experience with them. They had context I couldn't possibly have. Yet every time I asked for that context, I was made to feel incompetent. Week after week, code review after code review, pair programming session after pair programming session.

The worst part? I started to internalise it.

I spent months after passing my probation period feeling utterly depressed about my career. The impostor syndrome that had crept in during those early months took full hold. I went from being someone who was eager to learn and improve to someone who believed they were fundamentally not good enough for this industry. Each interaction chipped away a little more at my confidence until there was barely anything left.

And here's where I have to be honest: it wasn't entirely their fault.

## Becoming the Impostor

When you're constantly made to feel like you're not good enough, something shifts. I became unreliable. My performance suffered. I stopped trying as hard because I genuinely believed that nothing I did would meet their standards anyway. Why put in the effort when it would inevitably be met with disappointment?

Years later, I received an official ADHD diagnosis that explained a lot about why I struggled so much during this period, but that's a story for another time. What mattered in that moment was that I had entered a vicious cycle: I felt inadequate, so I performed inadequately, which reinforced the belief that I was inadequate.

I became the impostor I feared I was.

The irony is devastating. Impostor syndrome is the feeling that you're not as competent as others perceive you to be. But in my case, I actively became less competent because I believed I already was. The environment had eroded my confidence to such an extent that I couldn't function effectively.

Eventually, I was let go. In many ways, I saw it coming. But I left that role believing something that would take me a long time to unlearn: I thought I was genuinely bad at programming.

## The Turning Point

![Sunrise representing a new beginning](@/assets/images/blog/new-beginning-sunrise.jpg)

After leaving that role, I did something I should have done earlier: I took time to properly learn. Not just surface-level tutorials, but deep dives into the concepts I'd been exposed to. Event-driven architectures. Domain-Driven Design. System design patterns. Microservices architecture.

But more importantly, I started rebuilding my confidence.

My next role was a revelation. Within weeks, I realised something crucial: I had actually learnt an enormous amount during that difficult period. The technologies and patterns I'd struggled with before suddenly made sense. The concepts I thought I'd failed to grasp were now part of my mental toolkit.

The difference? I was in an environment where questions were genuinely welcomed. Where not knowing something wasn't treated as a character flaw. Where learning was expected, not merely tolerated.

I applied for more senior positions. I studied system design intensively. I worked on side projects that demonstrated the advanced concepts I'd learnt. And eventually, I landed my first Senior Software Engineer position at a financial startup.

Today, I'm the sole senior engineer controlling the entire backend infrastructure for a financial platform. I architect and maintain 13 microservices implementing Domain-Driven Design principles. I work with event-driven architectures using Pub/Sub. I design complex domain models for financial products. I've achieved 99.9% uptime for critical financial operations. I've led platform modernisation initiatives and mentored other engineers. The responsibility is mine, and I handle it with the confidence I once thought I'd never have.

I became the engineer I always believed I could be.

## What I learnt About Impostor Syndrome

![Person at mountain summit representing achievement and growth](@/assets/images/blog/mountain-summit-success.jpg)

Looking back, I've learnt several crucial things about impostor syndrome and toxic work environments:

### 1. The Environment Matters More Than You Think

Impostor syndrome isn't just an internal battle. It's profoundly influenced by your environment. You can be a competent engineer in one setting and feel completely inadequate in another, not because your skills have changed, but because the environment has changed how you perceive your skills.

Think about it: the same person with the same knowledge can thrive in one team and struggle in another. I went from feeling incompetent to landing a senior position in a relatively short time, not because I suddenly became a different engineer, but because I was finally in an environment that allowed me to demonstrate what I already knew.

Your environment shapes your confidence, your willingness to take risks, your ability to learn, and ultimately your performance. A toxic environment doesn't just make you feel bad; it actively impairs your ability to function at your best. Conversely, a supportive environment can unlock potential you didn't even know you had. When evaluating your own skills, always factor in the context. Are you truly struggling, or is your environment making it impossible to succeed?

### 2. "It's Okay to Ask Questions" Means Nothing Without Follow-Through

Words are cheap. If a team says it's okay to ask questions but responds with frustration and sighs when you do, they're not creating a psychologically safe environment. Pay attention to actions, not words.

This is perhaps one of the most damaging forms of workplace toxicity because it's so insidious. The team can claim they have a healthy learning culture while simultaneously punishing people for learning. It creates cognitive dissonance: you're told one thing but experience another, and you start to question your own perception of reality.

Real psychological safety isn't about what people say in onboarding documents or team charters. It's demonstrated in the daily interactions: How do people respond when you don't understand something? Is there patience in their explanations? Do they make you feel stupid for asking, or do they respect that you're trying to learn? A truly healthy team doesn't just tolerate questions; they welcome them as opportunities to share knowledge and improve documentation. If your gut tells you that asking questions is dangerous, trust that instinct. Your gut is reading the room correctly, even if the words being spoken suggest otherwise.

### 3. You Can Become the Impostor

This is the most insidious aspect of severe impostor syndrome. When you internalise the belief that you're not good enough, you can actually start performing below your capabilities. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Breaking this cycle requires either changing your environment or actively working to rebuild your confidence.

The psychological mechanism here is devastating. When you believe you're going to fail anyway, your brain starts to protect you from disappointment by reducing effort. Why try your hardest when it won't be good enough? This creates a vicious cycle: reduced effort leads to poorer results, which confirms your belief that you're not good enough, which further reduces effort.

I lived this cycle. I became unreliable. I stopped caring as much. Not because I was inherently a bad engineer, but because the constant negative feedback had eroded my motivation to the point where self-sabotage felt like self-preservation. The tragic irony is that impostor syndrome is supposed to be about feeling like a fraud despite being competent. But if left unchecked in a toxic environment, it can actually make you less competent, turning the fear into reality. Recognising this pattern is crucial. If you notice your performance declining in lockstep with your confidence, you're likely in this cycle. The solution isn't to try harder in the same environment; it's to break the cycle by changing something fundamental about your situation.

### 4. Experience and Knowledge Gaps Are Different Things

Someone who built a system will always have more context than someone new to it. This is a knowledge gap, not a competence gap. A good team understands this distinction. A toxic team treats knowledge gaps as if they're competence gaps.

This distinction is absolutely critical. If you join a team and don't understand their custom-built infrastructure and libraries, that's not a sign you're a bad engineer. It's a sign you're new. If you don't immediately grasp the domain-specific terminology they've used for years, that's not incompetence. It's inexperience with that specific domain.

Knowledge gaps close with time and good documentation. Competence gaps require fundamental skill development. The two require completely different approaches. When I was struggling on that team, my colleagues had years of context about systems they had built. Of course I didn't have that context. I couldn't have that context. No amount of innate talent would have given me knowledge of decisions made before I joined, architectural choices from years prior, or domain concepts they'd internalised over time.

A healthy team actively works to close knowledge gaps through documentation, patient explanations, and knowledge sharing. A toxic team uses knowledge gaps as weapons, making you feel stupid for not knowing things you couldn't possibly know. If you're being made to feel incompetent for lacking context you've never had access to, that's a red flag about the team, not about you.

### 5. Sometimes You Need to Walk Away

Not every job is worth saving. Not every team is worth the mental health toll. Sometimes the bravest thing you can do is recognise when an environment is fundamentally toxic and leave.

We're often told to persevere, to stick it out, to prove ourselves. There's a cultural narrative that leaving a difficult job is giving up or admitting defeat. But staying in a toxic environment isn't brave; it's self-destructive. There's a difference between a challenging role that stretches your abilities and a toxic role that destroys your confidence.

I stayed far longer than I should have because I thought leaving would prove I was the impostor I feared I was. I thought if I could just work hard enough, learn fast enough, be good enough, things would improve. But toxic environments don't improve just because you try harder. In fact, the harder you try in a fundamentally broken environment, the more damage it does.

Walking away isn't failure. It's recognising that your mental health, your confidence, and your career trajectory are more valuable than any single job. It's understanding that you can't grow in soil that's poisoned. Some of the best career decisions I've made involved recognising when a situation was unsalvageable and having the courage to leave. If you're in an environment that's destroying you, leaving isn't giving up. It's choosing yourself. And that is absolutely something that I believe is far more than just "okay". It's necessary.

### 6. You Learn More Than You Realise

Even in difficult situations, you're learning. I didn't realise how much I'd absorbed about microservices, event-driven architectures, and advanced system design until I was in an environment where I could actually apply that knowledge confidently.

This is perhaps the most hopeful lesson. Even when you feel like you're drowning, even when you think you're failing, even when impostor syndrome has convinced you that you're learning nothing, your brain is still absorbing information. You're building pattern recognition. You're developing problem-solving strategies. You're accumulating technical knowledge, even if you can't access it effectively in a high-stress environment.

When I left that job, I genuinely believed I had wasted all that time learning nothing. I was wrong. Within weeks of starting my next role, I found myself confidently discussing concepts that had seemed impossible before. I was implementing patterns I thought I'd failed to understand. The knowledge was there; it had just been locked away behind layers of anxiety and self-doubt.

Toxic environments don't just make you feel incompetent; they actively prevent you from recognising and demonstrating your competence. The knowledge is often there, buried under stress and fear. Once you remove the toxic environment, you'll likely be surprised by how much you actually learnt. Trust that even in the worst situations, you're growing. The growth might not be visible until you're somewhere that allows you to demonstrate it, but it's happening. Your struggle wasn't wasted, even if it felt like it at the time.

## To Anyone Currently Struggling

If you're reading this and you're currently in a situation where you feel like an impostor, where you question whether you're good enough for this industry, I want you to know something: it might not be you.

Yes, there are things you don't know. Yes, there are skills you need to develop. But if you're in an environment where asking questions is met with frustration, where your attempts are dismissed, where you constantly feel inadequate despite your efforts, the problem might not be your competence. It might be your environment.

I'm not saying you're perfect. I'm not saying you don't have things to learn. What I am saying is that learning requires psychological safety. It requires an environment where mistakes are treated as opportunities, not failures. Where questions are genuinely welcomed, not merely tolerated.

If you're not in that environment, consider whether it's worth staying.

## The Path Forward

Here's what helped me break free:

**1. Find Your People**

Seek out colleagues, communities, and mentors who genuinely support your growth. Not people who pay lip service to learning, but people who actively create environments where it's safe to not know things.

**2. Invest in Yourself**

When I left that toxic environment, I spent months deliberately learning. Not because I was fundamentally incompetent, but because I wanted to build confidence in my abilities. That investment paid off enormously.

**3. Recognise Your Growth**

Keep a record of what you've learnt and accomplished. When impostor syndrome strikes (and it will, even years later), you'll have concrete evidence of your capabilities.

**4. Set Boundaries**

You don't owe any job your mental health. If an environment is making you question your fundamental worth as an engineer, it's time to set boundaries or leave.

**5. Therapy and Professional Support**

If possible, seek professional help. I didn't realise how much the experience had affected me until I started talking about it with a therapist. My ADHD diagnosis also helped me understand why I struggled so much in certain environments.

## Looking Back

I don't regret taking that job, as strange as that might sound. Yes, it was one of the most difficult periods of my career. Yes, it nearly made me quit programming entirely. But it also taught me resilience. It taught me what kind of engineer I want to be and what kind of environments I want to work in.

More importantly, it taught me that impostor syndrome isn't always an internal battle. Sometimes it's a reflection of an external reality that needs to change.

Today, when I work with junior engineers, I remember how I felt in those code reviews. I remember the shame of asking questions. I remember the fear of not knowing something. And I make damn sure that nobody on my team ever feels the way I felt.

Because the difference between an impostor and a competent engineer isn't always technical knowledge. Sometimes it's just the environment they're in and the support they receive.

If you're struggling with impostor syndrome right now, please know: you might not be the impostor you think you are. You might just need a better environment to prove it to yourself.
