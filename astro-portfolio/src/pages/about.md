Hi there! I'm Harvey, a Senior Software Engineer based in London with 7+ years of experience building scalable distributed systems, financial platforms, and cloud-native applications. Currently architecting microservices for a wealth management platform at Propelle Ltd.

I specialise in designing and implementing complex financial systems using Domain-Driven Design principles, event-driven architectures, and cloud-native technologies. My experience spans from greenfield projects to legacy system modernisation, with a focus on building resilient, high-performance applications that handle critical financial operations.

## Current Focus

I'm currently working on modernising financial systems at Propelle, focusing on:
- Complex domain modelling for financial products with DDD principles
- Event-driven architecture with Google Cloud Pub/Sub
- API design for mobile applications with FastEndpoints
- Compliance and regulatory requirements (KYC, ISA regulations)
- Integration with third-party financial APIs (WealthKernel, Plaid, RevenueCat)

## Beyond Code

When I'm not building software:
- **Cars**: Restoring a classic E30 BMW (3-year labour of love) with plans for an engine conversion and turbocharger
- **Martial Arts**: Avid practitioner of Muay Thai and Boxing
- **Fitness**: Lost 36kg and passionate about helping others achieve their fitness goals through sustainable, healthy approaches
